# Deliveroo Autonomous Agent

The aim of the project is to develop an agent that plays autonomously the Deliveroo game.
It implements a BDI loop and decides over a set of possible plans to execute based on the state of the environment, including other game participants, strategy chosen and topology of the world perceived.

A PDDL planner has been used to perform path finding.

This project is created for the course "Autonomous Software Agents", UNITN, a.y. 2023/2024 by:

* [Ulises Emiliano Sosa](https://github.com/Ulises961)
* [Lorenzo Fumi](https://github.com/DeeJack)

## How to use

### Requirements

To run it requires a running environment of the [Deliveroo game](https://deliveroojs.onrender.com). You can also run the game locally by cloning the [repository](https://github.com/unitn-ASA/Deliveroo.js) and using the URL <http://locahost:8080/>.

Software requirements include:

* NodeJS (developed on NodeJS v18.18.2): to run the code
* Git: to clone the repository

### Getting started

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ulises961/Deliveroo-project/`
* Enter the source code directory: `cd Deliveroo-project/src`

### Configurations

Create a new file in the `src` directory called `.env`. A template file `.env-example` has been provided in the `src` directory.
Insert the configuration options:

* `TOKEN=[VALUE]`, replacing "[VALUE]" with the token obtained from the Deliveroo.js site.
* `URL=[VALUE]`, where "[VALUE]" is for example `https://deliveroojs.onrender.com`, or `http://locahost:8080/`
* Set `DEBUG=true` if you want to have console.logs about what the agent is doing.
* Set `DEBUG_LEVEL=3` to get console.logs with priority >= 3.
* You can choose to use either the PDDL planner or the "A*" algorithm for path finding by setting line 9 in the `index.js` file:

    `import './lib/plans/other/Library.js'`: for A*

    `import './lib/plans/other/Library.js'`: for PDDL planner.

* To use the planner, you need to add the following line to the `.env`:
  
    `PAAS_PATH='/package/dual-bfws-ffparser/solve'`
  
* If you are hosting the [planner yourself](https://github.com/AI-Planning/planning-as-a-service), set the planner's URL in the `.env`:

    `PAAS_HOST='http://localhost:5001'`

### Run the code - single agent

* Install the dependencies: `npm install`
* Launch the application: `npm run start`


### Run the code - coordinated agents

* Install the dependencies: `npm install`
* In the `.env` file add entries `agent_1=[TOKEN]` and `agent_2=[TOKEN]`. 
* For each agent a new token must be generated by the application and inserted in the relative entries.  
* In two different terminals launch the application: `npm run start agent_1` and `npm run start agent_2`
